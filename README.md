# Spectrometer

I'm really proud of this project because it works XD.

I've used the TOSHIBA TC1003 as linear ccd sensor and a Teensy 4.1 board for controlling and reading the sensor.

This is the kind of graph that my system can produce. In this sample image there is a measure of the spectrum of a fluorecent lamp
